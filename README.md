# PickMe: A Web-based Voting Application using Blockchain and PHP (CodeIgniter)

## Introduction
This document outlines the architecture and features of a web-based voting application built using blockchain technology and PHP on the CodeIgniter framework. The application aims to provide a secure and transparent voting system for various elections in campuses.

## Features
1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - Users can create accounts and authenticate themselves using their school email and a generated One-Time Password(OTP).
   - Authentication ensures that each user has a unique identity and can access the voting system securely.

2. Election Creation and Management:
   - Administrators can create and manage elections by defining the election parameters (e.g., start/end date, candidate list).
   - Each election is represented as a blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.

3. Candidate Registration:
   - Administrators register and approve the valid candidate nominations.

4. Secure Voting:
   - Users can cast their votes securely using the web application.
   - Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof results.

5. Vote Counting and Results:
   - The system automatically tallies the votes and calculates the results.
   - Results are displayed in real-time, providing transparency and trust in the election process.

6. Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts:
   - Utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to store and secure the election data.
   - Smart contracts, written in Solidity, are deployed on the Ethereum network to represent the election logic and data storage.

7. Integration with MetaMask and Ganache:
   - MetaMask, a browser extension, is integrated to interact with the Ethereum network and sign transactions securely.
   - Ganache, a local blockchain network, is used for testing and development purposes.

8. CodeIgniter Framework:
   - Built using the CodeIgniter framework, a lightweight PHP framework with MVC architecture.
   - CodeIgniter provides a structured approach to developing the application and ensures scalability and maintainability.

9. Security Measures:
   - Implements robust security measures such as encryption, secure user authentication, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

10. User Interface:
   - The application provides a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.
   - Responsive design for optimal user experience desktop devices.

## Technology Stack
- PHP 8.2.8 or [later] (https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)
- CodeIgniter Framework
- Git
- `composer` command (See [Composer Installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx))
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Front-end)
- MySQL (Database)
- Ethereum Blockchain (Smart Contracts, Solidity)
- MetaMask (Ethereum Wallet and Interaction)
- Ganache (Local Blockchain Network)

### Install CodeIgniter

```
$ composer create-project chari/codeigniter-composer-installer codeigniter
```

Above command installs `public/.htaccess` to remove `index.php` in your URL. If you don't need it, please remove it.

And it changes `application/config/config.php`:

~~~
$config['composer_autoload'] = FALSE;

$config['composer_autoload'] = realpath(APPPATH . '../vendor/autoload.php');
~~~

~~~
$config['index_page'] = 'index.php';

$config['index_page'] = '';
~~~

### Run PHP built-in server (PHP 5.4 or later)

```
$ cd /path/to/codeigniter
$ bin/server.sh
```

### Update CodeIgniter

```
$ cd /path/to/codeigniter
$ composer update
```

You must update files manually if files in `application` folder or `index.php` change. Check [CodeIgniter User Guide](http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/upgrading.html).

## Ganache
Personal Ethereum Blockchain. (Local VM).

### Download & Install
Download: https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/

### Run Ganache
We can following these steps:
1. Open ganache, choose `Quickstart`. 
2. We can see 10 address account simulator for each 100 eth. 
3. If we click on :key: `Key Button` We can see Account Information about the `Account Address` and `Private Key`. 

### Ganache connect to Metamask

After we running the Ganache. We can connect the network to the metamask.

Following these steps:
1. Open the Metamask. And Click on dropdown Network. 
2. Choose `Add Network` and will redirect to these settings. 
3. Choose `Add a network manually` and will open these form network. 
4. Input the network settings for `Ganache`, you can follow these input. 
   1.  Network Name: `Ganache`
   2.  New RPC URL: `HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545`
   3.  Chain ID: `1337`
   4.  Currency Symbol: `ETH`
5. Save, and we can see the Network Ganache already added. 

### Import Ganache Account to Metamask
We want to import the Ganache Account to metamask, we can follow these steps:
1. Open the account section, and choose `Import Account`.
2. It will show the form import account.
3. Copy the `Private Key` on Ganache before, then copy it to the metamask private key form. 
4. After that, click `Import` button. We will see the `Account Address` and `Balance` are same like as in `Ganache Account`. We can adding multiple accounts from Ganache to Metamask.

## Deployment
- The application can be deployed on a web server or cloud platform capable of running PHP applications.
- Database setup and configuration are required to store user data, candidate information, and election details.
- Integration with a blockchain network is necessary to implement the blockchain-based voting system.

## Conclusion
The web-based voting application built using blockchain technology and PHP on the CodeIgniter framework offers a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for conducting elections. With features like user authentication, candidate nomination, secure voting, and real-time results, the application ensures a trustworthy and tamper-proof election process.
